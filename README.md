## Introduction

## Usage

### Commit message convention

For this repository we suggest you to follow this convention:
> **[Module affected]: [Commit message in imperative form]**

 Examples:

| :heavy_check_mark: Do this                                            | :x: Don't do this                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Scripts: Update batch files                                           | *Scripts: Fixed paths in preprocess.bat    |
| Powershell: Get object size inside folders                            | +Updating some feature in any other module |
| PS Script: get size of only file in folder, delete file from list csv | Add a file in some folder                  |

Notes on writing commits:

- Write in imperative sentences: Add, Update, Fix, Refactor, Remove, Optimize, etc.
- Capitalize the first letter, no periods at the end of the line.
- If needed, you can describe in more detail on the line below after a blank line.

### Git Rules for Team Collaboration
1. Branch Regulations
Default development on dev branch
Do not commit directly to main unless there is a release tag
Name the branch in the form:
```php
feature/<feature-name>
fix/<issue-name>
```
Examples: feature/data-cleaning, fix/memory-leak
2. Commit & Push process
- Always pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
- Write clear commit messages according to established standards
- Do not push large files, sensitive data, or .env files
3. Pull Request (PR)
- When the task is complete, create a PR from your branch to dev
- Clearly describe the purpose of the PR and the content of the change
- Tag the reviewer if necessary
4. Conflict Resolution
- If there are conflicts when merging, resolve the conflict carefully and test again before pushing
- If unsure, ask your teammates to handle it
5. File và Folder Structure
- Keep your directory structure clean and standard
- Name your files meaningfully, in lowercase, and with hyphens: data-cleaning.py, eda-notebook.ipynb
6. Ignore files
- All temporary files, sensitive data, large output (checkpoints, model weights, .csv) should be added to .gitignore
